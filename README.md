# Luenberger observer
Our goal is to synthesize a luenberger observer for a damped pendulum with sinusoidal excitation using neural networks to learn the transformation $z=T(x)$ and its inverse $x=T^{-1}(z)$.

We will then test the robustness of the model by applying a sinusoidal excitation with a slightly variable frequency then with a larger frequency jump
