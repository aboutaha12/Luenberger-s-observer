# KKL observer for a nonlinear system with inputs

Our goal is to synthesize a numerical nonlinear Luenberger observer (KKL observer) for a damped pendulum with measured position and sinusoidal excitation. Because the input is not known in advance, we design the observer for the class of sinusoidal inputs with constant frequency generated by a three-dimensional exosystem. In other words, we design a functional KKL observer for an autonomous extended system with input model reconstructing the state from the knowledge of the input and output.  Neural networks are used to learn the transformation into KKL contration coordinates and its inverse. 

We then test the robustness of this observer by applying to the system inputs that are not exactly in the considered class, namely sinusoidal excitations with a slightly variable frequency and then a larger frequency discontinuity.

This work was carried out by Taha Balkhi at the Centre Automatique et Systèmes, Mines Paris, Université PSL, during a research trimester supervised by Pauline Bernard and Florent Di Meglio.
